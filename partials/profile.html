<h1>PERSON PROFILE</h1>
The Person Profile content type provides a standard format for displaying information about faculty, staff and students across KU websites. The profiles are very flexible and contain fields for many types of information. The information can be pulled from Faculty Pro, if the individual is a tenured or tenure track faculty member, or can be entered manually.
