AngularJS-Navigation-Menu
==========================
This application can be use as a simple example of : 

- How to start an angularJS app with nice directory structure and well-named files
- How to declare properly services, directives, etc, in a readable, scalable way.
It was first forked from the Angular Seed project, but was very simplified, I also added a few basic concept (dependency injection, real-world directive) that should appear in such example.
**Note:** There are no tools or server required to run this example.

## Install and run

This application can be use as a simple example of : 
-you can run in local server also
- Open 'index.html' with Firefox, OR launch chrome with the "--allow-file-access-from-files" option, then open 'index.html' with it
- woaw, it works ! just open index.html and files under the js/ with your favorite text editor to understand how things happen.



## Directory structure (interesting parts)
```
-index.html
-js/
  |__routes.js 
```
